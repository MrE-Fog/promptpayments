    <h4 class="heading-small">Average time to pay in days</h4>
    <ul class="list list-bullet">
        <li>Out of all the payments you made in the reporting period, the average time it took to pay. Only include payments that you have made during the reporting period. A payment is counted as 'made' when it is available to the supplier, (eg when it clears their bank account or when they receive cash) unless delayed by unforeseen circumstances.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 class="heading-small">Percentage of invoices not paid within agreed terms</h4>
    <ul class="list list-bullet">
        <li>This relates to the number of invoices, not their value. Count all invoices that were due during the reporting period, including unpaid or disputed ones.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 class="heading-small">Percentage of invoices paid</h4>
    <ul class="list list-bullet">

    <h4 class="heading-small">Standard Payment Terms</h4>
    <ul class="list list-bullet">
        <li>This must include your standard contractual payment period in days and a description of your standard payment terms. If you have different terms for different types of supplier, you should explain them. Most companies write a couple of paragraphs here.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 class="heading-small">Your maximum contractual payment period</h4>
    <ul class="list list-bullet">
        <li>This is the longest payment period agreed with a supplier for a contract signed in this reporting period. You can just put the number of days, or you can add an explanation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 class="heading-small">Changes to standard terms</h4>
    <ul class="list list-bullet">
        <li>If you changed your standard terms, this should include details of exactly what has changed: be sure to include the ‘before’ and ‘after’ situation. You must also state whether you consulted and notified suppliers about any changes. Most companies write a couple of paragraphs here.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 class="heading-small">Your dispute resolution process</h4>
    <ul class="list list-bullet">

    <h4 class="heading-small">Does your business offer e-invoicing?</h4>
    <ul class="list list-bullet">
        <li>This is where suppliers can electronically submit invoices and track invoices. It’s not just allowing suppliers to email you an invoice.</li>
        <li>Select ‘yes’ or ‘no’.</li>

    <h4 class="heading-small">Does your business offer supply chain finance options?</h4>

        <li>This is a system where a supplier's invoice can be paid by a third-party company, who you then pay at a later date.</li>
        <li>Select ‘yes’ or ‘no’.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 class="heading-small">Does your business have a policy of deducting sums from payments as a charge for remaining on a supplier list?</h4>
    <ul class="list list-bullet">
        <li>Select ‘yes’ or ‘no’.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 class="heading-small">In this reporting period, has your business deducted sums from payments as a charge for remaining on a supplier list?</h4>
    <ul class="list list-bullet">
        <li>You must answer this even if you answered ‘no’ to the above question.</li>
        <li>Select ‘yes’ or ‘no’.</li>
